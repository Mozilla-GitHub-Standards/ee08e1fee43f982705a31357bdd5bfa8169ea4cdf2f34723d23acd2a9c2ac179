Tools for Gecko/Firefox/Firefox OS developers

This repository is for collecting various tools that Gecko and Firefox developers have
created for making their lives easier in one place.  Issues will be tracked on github,
and pull requests will be accepted for new contributions.

No organization as of now; it will evolve as more utils get added.
